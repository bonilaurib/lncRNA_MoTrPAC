# lncRNA_MoTrPAC

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate multiple cellular processes. However,
knowledge of the responses and regulatory functions of lncRNAs in physical exercise
and training remains limited. As part of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity
Consortium (MoTrPAC), we conducted a comprehensive analysis of lncRNA
expression patterns in 18 tissues after an 8week progressive endurance training
program in rats. The lncRNA expression pattern was largely tissue-specific. In total,
759 unique lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed across all tissues,
generally displaying lower abundance, shorter transcript length, and reduced GC
content compared with protein-coding genes. The most pronounced changes were
observed in white and brown adipose tissues, the hypothalamus, and the adrenal
gland. In the two skeletal muscle tissues investigated, only two lncRNAs were
commonly differentially expressed. White and brown adipose tissues revealed a
correlation between upregulated differentially expressed lncRNAs and coding genes
associated with immune regulation. We identified substantial sex differences in the
lncRNA regulatory landscape in response to exercise training. This comprehensive
tissue-specific characterization of exercise-responsive lncRNAs opens new avenues
for understanding exercise as molecular medicine and may inform the development of
lncRNA-targeted therapeutics that harness the beneficial effects of exercise.
